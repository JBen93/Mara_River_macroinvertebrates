Quarto has a native embedding of Mermaid diagrams. This allows to create flow charts such as a foodweb. For this to work the output format needs to be set to html.

For this it is best to set the Render settings (next to Render above this pane) to "Preview in Viewer Pane"

The mermaid syntax can also be developed in the online [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)

```{r libraries}
#| label: setup 
#| include: false
#| eval: true
library(DiagrammeR)
```

```{mermaid}

  A[short grass] --> |R2=0.4|B(Thomson's gazelle) --> I{cheetah}
  A ==important==> C(wildebeest) --> J{lion}
  D[tall grass] --> E(zebra) --> J
  D --> F(buffalo) --> J
  D --> G(elephant)
  H[trees] --> G
