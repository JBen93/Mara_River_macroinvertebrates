psych::pairs.panels(envdat,smooth=F,ci=T,ellipses=F,stars=T,method="spearman")
# note that the units are very different! 

##### Ordination: run a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the environmental data
# .scale=T means: use correlations instead of covariances
# use .scale=T for datasets where the variables are measured in different use

# first remove points with Na values (make rownames a column, filter and remove again)

pca_env<-prcomp(envdat1,center=T, scale=T)# center and scale the data
summary(pca_env) # show the summary of the pca

#show the site scores for axis 1
pca_env$x
# the PCs are reduced dimensions of the dataset
# you reduce 6 variables to 2 dimensions
# make a biplot (variable scores plus sample score) the pca ordination
biplot(pca_env,xlab="PC1 49%", ylab="PC2 21%")

##### ordination: calculate and plot a Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordination
# explore the distance (dissimilarity) in species composition between plots

##### improve the NMDS ordination plot by only showing the dominant species
# non-metric multidimension scaling / indirect gradient analysis (only species composition)


# and show the ordination with the most abundance species with priority


#### ordination: compare to a DCA -> decide what ordination we should do, linear or unimodal? 
# how long are the gradients? Should I use linear (PCA)or unimodal method (NMDS, DCA)

# first axis is 8.1 standard deviations of species responses
# result: length of first ordination axis is >8 standard deviations
# only when <1.5 you can use a PCA or RDA
# plot the dca results as a biplot

##### fit the environmental factors to the dca ordination surface

#add the result to the ordination plot as vectors for each variable

##### add contour surfaces to the dca ordination for the relevant abiotic variables

##### make the same plot but using a nmds
##### fit the environmental factors to the nmds ordination surface

##### fit the environmental factors to the dca ordination surface

#add the result to the ordination plot as vectors for each variable

##### add contour surfaces to the nmds ordination for the relevant abiotic variables


##### compare an unconstrainted (DCA) and constrained (CCA) ordination
# did you miss important environmental factors?
# show the results of the detrended correspondence analysis

# the eigenvalues represent the variation explained by each axis

# kick out variables that are least significant - simplify the model


# add the environmental factors to the cca ordination plot


# test if the variables and axes (margins) are significant

# You have measured the right things!
# for example - test this if you would have only measured clay thickness

# yes, clay thickness significantly affects vegetation composition

##### cluster analysis (classification) of  communities
# first calculate a dissimilarity matrix, using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity


 # show the dissimilarity matrix (1= completely different, 0= exactly the same)


# now cluster the sites based on similarity in species composition 
# using average linkage as the sorting algorithm


# back to  clustering based on species composition - show the dendrogram and cut in in 4 communities


##### add the clustering of plots to your cca ordination

#add the vegetation type to the environmental data

# test if DistGulley_m is different between the vegetation types

# what do you write: 
# the vegetation types were significantly different in distance to gulley (F3,18=21.36, P<0.001)
# * P<0.05, ** P<0.01, *** P<0.001

# means with the same letter are not significantly different
